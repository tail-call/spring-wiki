# Exceptions

In Java, exceptions are objects that represent exceptional conditions that can occur during the execution of a program. When an exceptional condition occurs, such as an error or unexpected situation, an exception object is created and thrown by the code that detects the problem. This exception can then be caught and handled by other parts of the program.

Here are the key components and concepts related to Java exceptions:

1. **Throwable Class Hierarchy**:
   - All exceptions in Java are subclasses of the `Throwable` class. There are two main subclasses of `Throwable`: `Exception` and `Error`.
   - `Exception` represents exceptional conditions that a user's code should catch and handle, such as input validation errors, file I/O errors, or network communication errors.
   - `Error` represents serious system-level errors that are typically beyond the control of the application, such as out-of-memory errors or stack overflow errors.

2. **Checked and Unchecked Exceptions**:
   - Checked exceptions are exceptions that the compiler requires you to catch or declare in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`, etc.
   - Unchecked exceptions (also known as runtime exceptions) are exceptions that do not need to be caught or declared explicitly. They are subclasses of `RuntimeException` and typically represent programming errors or logic flaws, such as `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, etc.

3. **Throwing Exceptions**:
   - Exceptions can be thrown explicitly using the `throw` statement. For example:
     ```java
     throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid argument");
     ```

4. **Catching Exceptions**:
   - Exceptions are caught using the `try-catch` block. The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception, and the `catch` block handles the exception if it occurs. For example:
     ```java
     try {
         // Code that may throw an exception
     } catch (ExceptionType e) {
         // Exception handling code
     }
     ```

5. **Finally Block**:
   - The `finally` block is used to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup tasks, such as closing resources. For example:
     ```java
     try {
         // Code that may throw an exception
     } catch (Exception e) {
         // Exception handling code
     } finally {
         // Cleanup code
     }
     ```

6. **Exception Propagation**:
   - If an exception is thrown inside a method and not caught within that method, it is propagated up the call stack until it is caught or until it reaches the top-level method (e.g., `main()`), where it may terminate the program if not handled.

7. **Custom Exceptions**:
   - You can create custom exception classes by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Custom exceptions are useful for representing application-specific errors or exceptional conditions.

Overall, exceptions provide a mechanism for handling errors and unexpected situations in Java programs, improving robustness, and reliability. Proper exception handling is essential for writing stable and maintainable code.
