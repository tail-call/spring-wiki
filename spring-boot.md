# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal setup and configuration. It is built on top of the Spring Framework and follows the "[convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)" principle, aiming to simplify and accelerate the development process.

Key features of Spring Boot include:

1. **Auto-configuration**: Spring Boot automatically configures the application based on dependencies present in the classpath, reducing the need for manual configuration.

2. **Standalone**: Spring Boot applications can be run as standalone JAR files, which embed an embedded servlet container like [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), Jetty, or Undertow, eliminating the need for deploying to an external application server.

3. **Spring Boot Starter**: Spring Boot provides a set of starter dependencies, which simplify the inclusion of common dependencies for various functionalities like web development, data access, security, etc.

4. **Actuator**: Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in production-ready features such as monitoring, health checks, metrics, and more, which can be easily integrated into the application.

5. **Spring Boot CLI**: Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to quickly develop Spring Boot applications using Groovy scripts.

6. **Spring Boot DevTools**: Spring Boot DevTools provide additional development-time features like automatic restart, which enhances developer productivity.

7. **Embedded Server Support**: Spring Boot supports embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, allowing you to run your application as a standalone executable JAR with an embedded server.

8. **Spring Boot Starters**: These are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology that you need, without having to hunt through sample code and copy-paste loads of dependency descriptors.

Overall, Spring Boot simplifies the process of building and deploying Spring-based applications by providing sensible defaults and reducing boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus more on business logic rather than infrastructure setup and configuration.
