# Jakarta EE

Jakarta EE (Enterprise Edition) is an open-source, community-driven platform for developing and deploying enterprise Java applications. It was formerly known as [Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition)](java-ee.md) until the transfer of its stewardship from Oracle Corporation to the Eclipse Foundation in 2017.

Jakarta EE provides a set of specifications, APIs, and runtime environments that enable developers to build scalable, secure, and portable enterprise applications. It includes features such as web services, servlets, [JavaServer Pages (JSP)](jsp.md), [Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)](ejb.md), [Java Persistence API (JPA)](jpa.md), and more.

Key components and concepts of Jakarta EE include:

1. **Specifications**: Jakarta EE specifications define standard APIs and programming models for various enterprise technologies, such as servlets, JSP, JPA, JMS (Java Message Service), CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection), and more. These specifications are developed collaboratively by the Jakarta EE community.

2. **Compatibility**: Jakarta EE specifications aim to ensure compatibility across different Jakarta EE implementations, allowing applications to be deployed on any compliant Jakarta EE runtime environment without modification.

3. **Runtime Environment**: Jakarta EE applications are typically deployed to Jakarta EE-compatible application servers or runtimes, which provide the necessary infrastructure and services for executing Jakarta EE applications. Examples of Jakarta EE-compatible servers include Eclipse GlassFish, WildFly, Apache TomEE, Payara Server, and others.

4. **Tooling and Ecosystem**: Jakarta EE has a rich ecosystem of development tools, frameworks, and libraries that support the development, testing, and deployment of enterprise Java applications. This ecosystem includes IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans, as well as build tools like Maven and Gradle.

5. **Community Collaboration**: Jakarta EE is developed collaboratively by the Jakarta EE community, which includes individuals, organizations, and companies working together to evolve the platform, develop new specifications, and drive innovation in enterprise Java development.

Overall, Jakarta EE continues to be a popular choice for building enterprise applications due to its robustness, portability, and extensive ecosystem support. The transition to the Eclipse Foundation has further strengthened its commitment to openness, transparency, and community-driven development.
